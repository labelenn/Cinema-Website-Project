This website application is a project that I created for the course Full Stack Development Semester 2 2023.
This course was taken by me during my second year of Bachelor of Software Engineering at RMIT University Australia.
This website application is built on:
- React
- CSS
- MySQL
- Express
- Sequelize
- GraphQL
- REST API

Lance Belen - s3944846

To run the website application:
- cd to react-app then run 'npm start'
- cd to nodejs-express-sequelize-mysql then run 'node server.js'

To run the tests:
- Run 'npm test'
- You may have to press 'a' as well to run all tests
- Number of Test Suites: 4
- Number of Tests: 19

HD Implementation:
- To get to the Admin Dashboard - On the home page of the website, scroll down to the Footer and click on "For Admins" below "Contact us".
- Data is fetched through GraphQL.
- Admin is able to delete review, block, and unblock a user.
- Blocked users are also not allowed to add a new review or edit their existing reviews.
- Deleted reviews are display as a prompt that it has been deleted by admin.
- Create, edit, and update movie information.
- Movies stored in the database and retrieved from the database when displayed on the website.
- Movie display is also fetched through GraphQL.
- NOTE: Visual data analytics generation is the only part of HD that I have not implented.
